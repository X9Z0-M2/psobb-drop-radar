## PSOBB Drop Radar Addon

Drop Radar will simplify shifting through piles of monomates, difluids, and other useless drops by providing real-time directional indication to the valuable ones. While some psobb clients may also have minimap indicators for rare drops or even allow you to customize which drops show up on the minimap, this adds another level of detail by filtering %hit weapons or meseta >1k, by showing if you're headed in the right direction.

### Installation
* Using standard git features you may clone, or choose to download as a .zip file.
    * Extract .zip

* Place "Drop Radar" folder inside the "addons" folder where all the other psobb addons are.
    * Note: all files; *init.lua*, *configuration.lua*, *options.lua* must be inside "Drop Radar" 


### Configuration
This is straight-forward if you're at all used to other psobb lua addons utilizing imgui.
- Load up the game, and join or create a party to, and enter into an easy combat zone.
- Press ` (*backtick char*) to open addon menu if it isn't already
- Click "Drop Radar" to bring up the configuration menu.
- Double click the "Drop Radar - Configuration" window to expand it fully, if it isn't already.
- You'll now see all the various options and can adjust the hud size, position, and drop heights you'd like each type of drop to have. (*slide over to 0 to remove visibility*)
